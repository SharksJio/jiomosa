-- Guacamole database initialization script
-- This is a minimal schema for basic Guacamole functionality

-- Create schema
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS guacamole;

-- Note: For a production setup, you should use the official Guacamole schema
-- This can be obtained from: https://github.com/apache/guacamole-client/tree/master/extensions/guacamole-auth-jdbc/modules/guacamole-auth-jdbc-postgresql/schema

-- For this PoC, the Guacamole container will auto-initialize if needed
-- This file serves as a placeholder for custom initialization if required
